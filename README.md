Planned Updates and Changes 🚀
Migrating the codebase to using React and Firestore to reduce data loading time and enable the implementation of the following features!

Schedule/Workshops/Events Page: Rename to "Day Of" and link to the hacker guide. Implement a day-by-day view of the schedule for the in-person event. Display a calendar view with color-coded blocks for workshops, social events, etc.

About Us Page: Add a dropdown for "Team" to navigate to a separate page or scroll to the corresponding section.

Sponsors Page: Create a clear landing spot for sponsor information and sign up. Include sections for prospective sponsors (tiers, benefits, contact info) and sponsor login (portal and credentials provided by the team).

Live: Implement a real-time updates section during the event.

Other: Add a dark mode option, a magic wand icon for mode switching, and enhance visibility of social media links. Update the "Past Projects" section to include 2022 projects.
