# Pearl Hacks Marketing Website 🌟

This README file documents the progress and tech stack used to develop the Pearl Hacks marketing website for the 2024 hackathon.

## Current Website Structure 🏗️

- **Home Page** (`index.html`): Displays event information and includes a dynamic "Happening Now" section based on the user's time zone.

- **About Us** (`about_us.html`): Provides details about Pearl Hacks and the organizing team.

- **FAQs & Guidelines** (`faqs.html`): Answers frequently asked questions and provides guidelines for participants.

- **Resource List** (`__.html`): Offers a curated list of resources for participants.

- **Static Materials** (`static_materials.html`): Provides downloadable logos, banners, and other promotional materials.

- **Style Guide** (`styleguide.html`): Outlines design and branding guidelines for the Pearl Hacks website.

- **Blog** (`blog/`): A hardcoded blog section with limited functionality. Future plans include expanding content and capabilities.

- **404 Page Not Found** (`404.html`): A page served when the URL does not match a valid path, using root-relative links for accessibility.

- **Assets** (`assets/`): Directories for images, fonts, and miscellaneous assets. Also includes `styles.css` for website styling.

- **Scripts** (`scripts/`): Contains scripts for injecting information from Google Sheets and other JavaScript logic.

- **Components** (`components/`): HTML code for the navigation bar (`navbar.html`) and footer (`footer.html`).

## Planned Updates and Changes 🚀

- **Navigation Bar**: Combine "Schedule," "Workshops," and "Events" into a single "Schedule" page.

- **Schedule/Workshops/Events Page**: Rename to "Day Of" and link to the hacker guide. Implement a day-by-day view of the schedule for the in-person event. Display a calendar view with color-coded blocks for workshops, social events, etc.

- **About Us Page**: Add a dropdown for "Team" to navigate to a separate page or scroll to the corresponding section.

- **Sponsors Page**: Create a clear landing spot for sponsor information and sign up. Include sections for prospective sponsors (tiers, benefits, contact info) and sponsor login (portal and credentials provided by the team).

- **Live**: Implement a real-time updates section during the event.

- **Other**: Add a dark mode option, a magic wand icon for mode switching, and enhance visibility of social media links. Update the "Past Projects" section to include 2022 projects.
