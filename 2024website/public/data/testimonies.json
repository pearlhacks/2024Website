      "experience": "Pearl Hacks was so much fun! I donâ€™t often have a good chance to sit down for an entire day and work on something unrelated to class for hours on end, so Pearl Hacks was the perfect opportunity to harness my creativity and ideas and see what I could make with my partner. Of course, I also loved all the free swag we got! I was initially very nervous to demo, but once we got into it, I really enjoyed showing other people the project we made. Overall, it was an incredible experience and I enjoyed it so much!",

This experience allowed me to hone my design and presentation skills. I firmly believe that there is a place for everyone at Pearl Hacks, regardless of their background or experience level. The hackathon and participants inspired me to explore the possibilities in tech and exposed me to the essence of a supportive and empowering environment. ",
